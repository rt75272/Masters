# Mental Health NLP Chatbot.
#
# This script implements a simple NLP-based chatbot for mental health support.
# It uses basic intent classification to respond to user input about anxiety, ADHD, and
# depression. The bot also detects crisis phrases and provides emergency resources if 
# needed.
#
# Usage:
#   $ python nlp_chatbot.py

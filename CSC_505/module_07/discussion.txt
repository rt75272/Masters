The worst interface I have ever worked with is a patient records GUI system at a hospital. The program worked and did its job. However, the system was overly complicated and extremely redundant. In some cases, to conduct a single task the user needs to click on several different buttons. Which is inefficient when the task can be completed with a single button click. Furthermore, finding all those buttons you must click exposes the over complicated design of the system. The program’s GUI is scattered all over several pages and tabs. Making the user unintuitively click around while trying to complete a single task. Therefore, the worst interface I have worked with had an overly complicated design leading to extremely redundant usage.
The best interface I have ever worked with is arguably the Linux terminal interface. Specifically, a BASH powered shell called Konsole. However, this is perhaps relative to coming from the Windows Command Line(CMD). For example, when entering a command that is not quite correct the Windows CMD does not offer much in terms of support. Whereas, the Linux terminal will offer suggestions close to the incorrectly entered command. Thus potentially saving the user time by allowing the user to not need to look up commands. Therefore, this is one of the best interfaces I have worked with because it offered additional useful features when compared to some of its competitors. Which leads to a greater ease-of-use for the users.

Data Structures and Algorithms
Both data structures and algorithms are crucial for processing data. However, even though they both serve roughly the same overall goal they do possess slightly different functionality. A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data. Whereas, an algorithm is a step-by-step procedure to solve a problem. Furthermore, algorithms can be used to access and use the information stored in a data structure. For example, one might use an array to store data, and then use a linear search algorithm to locate certain elements within the array. Thus, data structures and algorithms, although different, work closely together in order to achieve a specific goal.
Data structure:
          # Array to store data.
    arr = [3, 42, 0, 5, 7, 99, -234]
Algorithm:
    # Algorithm to locate a given target within an array of n elements.
    def linear_search(arr, n, target):
        for i in range(0, n):
            if(arr[i] == target):
                return i
        return -1

Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have been one of the most revolutionary developments in computer science because they transformed how users interact with technology. Before GUIs, computers were mostly controlled through text-based command lines, requiring specialized knowledge and technical expertise. GUIs, by contrast, introduced intuitive visual elements like icons, buttons, and windows, making computers accessible to a broader audience, including those without programming skills. This shift paved the way for the widespread adoption of personal computers, fundamentally altering industries, education, and daily life.

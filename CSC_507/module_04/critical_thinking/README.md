## First Fit Memory Allocation

The First-Fit algorithm is a memory allocation strategy used by operating systems to allocate memory to processes. It is one of the simplest and most commonly used memory management algorithms.

How the First-Fit Algorithm Works:
Memory Blocks: The system has a collection of memory blocks, each with a certain size. These blocks are typically free or allocated to a process.

_Processes:_ Processes that need memory are assigned memory blocks to run. Each process requires a certain amount of memory (referred to as process size).

_Allocation Process:_
When a process requests memory, the First-Fit algorithm searches through the list of available memory blocks in order (from the lowest address to the highest).
The algorithm allocates the first memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process.
Once a block is found, the process is placed into that block, and the block is marked as occupied (or "allocated").
If no block is large enough, the process may not be allocated.

_Efficiency:_
First-Fit is efficient because it is relatively fast, as it only needs to search through the list of available blocks sequentially until a suitable one is found.
However, it can lead to fragmentation over time (both internal and external).
External Fragmentation: As processes are allocated and deallocated, small unusable gaps may appear between memory blocks, which may not be large enough to accommodate new processes.

Summary
	The Python code provided implements an A* search algorithm for a pathfinding problem, where the goal is to find the shortest path from a start point to a goal point on a grid, avoiding obstacles. A* is a heuristic search algorithm that is both complete and admissible. It guarantees finding the shortest path if one exists, and it does so efficiently by using an evaluation function that combines the actual cost to reach a node (from the start) with a heuristic estimate of the cost to reach the goal. The heuristic in this case is the Manhattan distance, which is admissible because it never overestimates the true cost to the goal. A* is relatively space-efficient compared to other search methods like breadth-first search, as it prunes suboptimal paths based on the evaluation function. However, it still requires significant memory due to the need to store explored nodes. One of the advantages of A* is that it can find optimal paths in a grid with varying costs or obstacles, but its memory usage can be a disadvantage in large-scale problems. The A* algorithm fits the intended function here by efficiently finding the shortest path in a grid-based pathfinding problem.

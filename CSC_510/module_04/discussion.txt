Despite its apparent simplicity, why is the traveling salesman problem challenging for human intuition to solve efficiently as the number of cities increases? What cognitive limitations come into play?

	The traveling salesman problem becomes challenging for human intuition as the number of cities increases because humans are limited by cognitive constraints in processing large amounts of information and evaluating all possible routes. As the number of cities grows, the number of potential routes grows exponentially, making it increasingly difficult to assess all possibilities. Humans tend to rely on heuristics, such as trying nearby cities first, but these methods often miss the optimal solution. Our brains are not wired to handle the complexity of such problems efficiently. This limitation in working memory and the need to make decisions based on incomplete or simplified information means that, unlike machine learning algorithms that can systematically explore all options, humans can only approximate solutions and are prone to missing the optimal route in large scale instances.

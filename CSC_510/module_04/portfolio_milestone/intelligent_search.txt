Adding Intelligent Search
	
	In a machine learning-powered real estate prediction application, intelligent search methods such as Best-First Search, Greedy Best-First Search, Beam Search, or A* Search can be leveraged to optimize property value predictions using features like location, property size, market trends, and historical data. Best-First Search would guide the search toward the most promising hyperparameter configurations by evaluating candidates based on a heuristic, while Greedy Best-First Search could speed up the process by selecting the most promising options at each step, though it may risk missing the optimal solution. Beam Search would allow for exploring multiple candidate solutions simultaneously, balancing breadth with computational efficiency, and A* Search could be applied for feature selection, finding the optimal set of features by considering both the cost of selection and its impact on model performance. These search techniques would enhance model training, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, ensuring that the real estate prediction model is accurate, efficient, and capable of forecasting market trends and property values.

Module 5: Portfolio Milestone	
	In a machine learning powered real estate app, classification can be a valuable tool for segmenting properties into distinct categories based on various factors such as price, location, type of property, or buyer preferences. For instance, a classification model could be used to predict whether a property will fall into a high demand or low demand category, allowing the app to provide users with tailored recommendations or alerts for properties that meet specific criteria. Additionally, classification models could predict the likelihood of a property’s price appreciating or depreciating based on market trends and historical data, helping investors make more informed decisions. By leveraging features like square footage, neighborhood crime rates, proximity to schools, and amenities, the app could classify properties into various risk categories, providing users with insights into potential investment opportunities or areas to avoid. Ultimately, classification models can enhance the user experience by offering personalized, data driven property insights, increasing engagement, and improving decision making.

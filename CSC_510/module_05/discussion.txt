DSS, broadly defined, is an interactive computer-based system that assists humans in decision-making, utilizing data and models to solve ill-structured, unstructured, or semi-structured problems. Can you think of an industry, field, or domain of expertise that, to your knowledge, does not use traditional DSS systems? What are the primary reasons for the limited adoption in this area? How would you convince the industry, field, or domain of expertise to adopt DSS systems?

The arts and creative industries, such as fine arts or music, have seen limited use of decision support systems (DSS). These fields prioritize creativity and intuition over data-driven decisions, with many professionals viewing technology as a hindrance to the creative process. To encourage DSS adoption, I would highlight how these systems can support artists by providing valuable insights into audience preferences, optimizing schedules, and managing resources—without stifling creativity. DSS can enhance decision-making efficiency, allowing creatives to focus more on their craft while benefiting from data-driven support.

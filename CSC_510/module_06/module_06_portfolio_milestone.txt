Module 6: Portfolio Milestone	
	In my machine learning powered real estate application, first-order logic can be effectively utilized to enhance the decision making process by applying rules and relationships between different properties, users, and the environment. For instance, first-order logic can model logical relationships between property features such as location, price, size, and amenities. Which could be used to determine which listings are most relevant to a user's search. By incorporating rules such as "if a property is within 10 miles of the user's desired area and its price is below their budget, then recommend this property," the application can filter, and rank properties based on user preferences. Additionally, first-order logic can be used to encode domain specific knowledge, such as the correlation between neighborhood crime rates and property prices. Thus, allowing the application to make inferences and adapt its recommendations based on these logical rules. This approach not only improves the precision of the recommendations but also ensures that the system's reasoning aligns with real world constraints and expectations (Russell & Norvig, 2016).
